<!-- Code Splitting
Bundling is great, but as your app grows, your bundle will grow too. Especially if you are including large third-party libraries. You need to keep an eye on the code you are including in your bundle so that you donâ€™t accidentally make it so large that your app takes a long time to load. -->
